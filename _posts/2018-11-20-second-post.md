## Model

The front end of the features of the Gtr give the car an aggressive look to it. To help cool the car's high-output engine, the dark chrome grille is expanded to collect more air, without reducing the car's aerodynamic performance. A structurally reinforced hood avoids deformation at tremendously high speeds, allowing it to keep its aerodynamic shape. The broad hood is reinforced to enhance stability during high speed driving. Unlike the standard model, the front bumper of the GT-R NISMO features layers of carbon-fiber sheets carefully overlapped to achieve the perfect amount of stiffness.
